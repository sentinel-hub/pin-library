### Grasberg Open Pit, Indonesia (Geology 12,8,2)

[<img src="fig/Grasbergs_Open_Pit_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/49657209443/in/dateposted/)For years the [Grasberg open pit mine](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/geology/chapter/reading-open-pit-mining/)  which forms 1.6km wide crater at the surface, has been one of the most productive mines in the world, with massive reserves of gold and copper. Situated high in the rugged Sudirman Mountains, Papua Indonesia, its [mineralization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/037567429490023X) extends from the surface at 4,200 m to the deepest drill penetrations at 2,700 m. The gold and copper bearing ore formed millions of years ago when hot magma intruded into sedimentary rock during the uplift of the local mountains.  Since the 1990s, the Grasberg highly sophisticated mining operation  has been busily extracting this ore at staggering [volumes](https://www.mining-technology.com/projects/grasbergopenpit/)  to the tune of  528 billion ounces of copper and 53 million ounces of gold.  It transitioned into an [underground mine](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/grasberg-block-cave-underground-mine/) in 2019. Unfortunately, the dumping of millions of tons of waste [tailings](https://www.tailings.info/basics/tailings.htm) directly into the nearby [Ajkwa river system](https://earthworks.org/stories/ajkwa-estuary/) has not only devasted aquatic life but also caused a steadily growing floodplain of desolation, killing thousands of hectares of verdant forest and mangroves and continues to leave the locals [counting the cost](https://theinsiderstories.com/indonesia-will-summon-freeport-on-environmental-damage/)

### Meteor Crater, Arizona

The Arizona [Meteor Crater](https://www.meteorite.com/meteor-crater/) (Barringer Meteorite Crater) formed 50,000 years ago when an asteroid plunged through the Earth’s atmosphere and crashed into what would become central Arizona. The 10 second collision initially formed a crater over 1200m across and 200m deep. Subsequent erosion have shaved off parts of the rim and has partially filled the crater, which is now 1600m wide , 170m -deep gouge, yet the arid climate has done its share to preserve the crater’s original graceful look making it the best-preserved [impact crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_crater#:~:text=An%20impact%20crater%20is%20an,impact%20of%20a%20smaller%20body.) on Earth. Very little of the original mass of about 150,000 tons survived the impact, however bits and pieces of the space rock remain scattered throughout the crater, which has for years been a [tourist attraction](https://meteorcrater.com/) as well as a wonderful laboratory for scientists and researchers furthering the study of meteorite impacts

### Danakil Depression, Ethiopia (Geology 12,8,2)

[<img src="fig/Denakil_Depression_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/50082066913/in/dateposted/)Northern Ethiopia’s [Danakil Depression](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/84239/curiosities-of-the-danakil-depression), located in Danakil Desert, is one of the [hottest](https://www.autoeurope.co.uk/travel-blog/the-worlds-coldest-and-warmest-places/), driest and lowest places on earth. Parts of the region are more than 100m below sea level, forming a cauldron where temperatures average 34 0C and at times climb to 50 0C. Worse, it only receives 100 to 200mm of rainfall per year. The climate here can only be described as cruel. But against all odds, [people](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160614-the-people-and-creatures-living-in-earths-hottest-place) do live here and for centuries the locals have survived mining and selling [salt blocks](https://www.fairplanet.org/story/the-hottest-place-on-earth-the-salt-mines-of-danakil-depression/) left behind after evaporation. As if the climate was not enough, the region's energetic geology makes it look like an alien land. There are volcanoes with bubbling lava lakes, multi-coloured hydrothermal fields, and great salt pans, all of which manifest themselves in the vibrant combination of yellows, oranges, and reds that make the landscape look equal parts [neon and deadly](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170803-in-earths-hottest-place-life-has-been-found-in-pure-acid). It is thought that somewhere in the future this geological depression caused by the drifting of three tectonic plates will have drifted enough that the Red Sea will spill over, drowning this strange landscape into a new ocean. 

### National Reserve de l'Ancarana, Madagascar (Geology 8,11,12)

Containing a unique geological wonder, a spectacularly eroded limestone fortress of sharp ridges, [Ankarana National Park](https://www.madacamp.com/Ankarana_National_Park) is situated on a limestone plateau about 108km south of Antsiranana and covers 18,225ha. Ankarana has since earned a reputation for its limestone karst pinnacles called [tsingy](https://madagascar-tourisme.com/en/what-to-do/fauna-and-flora/tsingy/)  which  in Malagasy means "where one cannot walk barefoot”. Observing the tsingy from the air, pilots have been reminded of the deep urban canyons of Manhattan, because the formations have become like rows of high-rise apartment buildings, providing shelter to a different array of species at each level. The topography of the park is varied and in addition to the limestone ‘tsingies’ includes a dense tropical jungle, deciduous forest, canyons and an extensive cave system and network of underground rushing rivers -- some of which contain crocodiles. This variety of landscape makes it a popular choice among hikers offering [incredible trails](https://www.naturalworldsafaris.com/africa/madagascar/ankarana-national-park), unique and terrific landscapes and excellent wildlife viewing.

### The Great Blue Hole, Belize (Enhanced True Color)

Instead of its roaring waves and scary storms, the Caribbean sea often offers amazing natural wonders below its otherwise uncertain surface. [The Great Blue Hole of Belize](https://www.marineinsight.com/environment/what-is-the-great-blue-hole-of-belize/), located off the coast of Belize, is one of such wonders. Circular in shape with a diameter of 300 m, the water depth in this hole is 125m, which gives it a deep blue color in contrast with the aquamarine color of the water neighboring it. 
Researchers say this giant underwater [sinkhole](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/sinkholes?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects) was originally formed during the last glacial period as a limestone cave when the sea levels were lower. As the ocean began to rise due to [thawing](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/big-thaw/) of polar ice caps, the cave system flooded and eventually collapsed, creating a “vertical cave” in the ocean. As such, this swallow hole is popular among divers, who flock to the area to see the geological formations that now lie in the ocean’s depths.
[Researcher divers](https://geographical.co.uk/people/explorers/item/3132-explore-belize-blue-hole) have found huge [stalactites and stalagmites](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/stalactite.html) below the surface, some even reaching 9-12 m in length.  They say that the deeper one goes, the water becomes clearer and the formations, more complex. The Great Blue Hole is part of the larger Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System, a World Heritage Site of UNESCO.

### Namib Desert, Namibia (Geology 12,8,2)

With its [red sand dunes](https://www.earthmagazine.org/article/travels-geology-desert-geology-namibia-writer-and-her-father-explore-otherworldly-dunes) rolling endlessly into the ocean, the [Namib](https://www.rovos.com/the-namib-desert) is the oldest desert in the world, existing for at least 55 million years, stretching over 2000km along Namibia‘s entire Atlantic coast and parts of Angola and South Africa. This extremely [arid ecoregion](https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1315) features dunes, rocky mountainous areas, gravel plains, perennial river mouth wetlands, coastal pans, lagoons, riparian vegetation and isolated springs resulting in a landscape of exceptional beauty. With rainfall varying from 85mm in the west to just 2mm in the east, coastal fog is the primary source of water accounting for a unique environment in which endemic [plants and animals](https://www.britannica.com/place/Namib#ref37004) adapt to an ever-changing variety of microhabitats and ecological niches. Despite its emptiness, the desert scenery of the Namib has a stark beauty with its striking patterns created by the constantly shifting sand dunes to the dramatic coastline, where shipwrecks shrouded in fog disintegrate slowly into the sand. In addition to being home to the famous solitary [Sossusvlei Dunes](https://www.sossusvlei.org/about/), it is also the site of major mines for tungsten, salt and diamonds.

### Fjords of Norway (Geology 12,8,2)

A [fjord](https://www.visitflam.com/editorial-content/everything-you-should-know-about-the-fjords-of-norway/?referrer=4464&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6ar4BRDnARIsAITGzlAyf5HypXDOQeJ4RTYb1M0hft5j1lpMTFV0qZcktbYwBuaVyK2iYe0aAvi1EALw_wcB) is a story of water, ice and mountains. It is a long, deep, narrow body of water that reaches far inland. Fjords are often set in a U-shaped valley with steep walls of rock on either side. While fjords are not just a Norwegian phenomenon and can be found in other mountainous regions, the [fjords of Norway](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Fjords_of_Norway) are particularly famous, spread all over the country and easily accessible as the fjord-dominated landscape runs like a strip all around Norway's coast. They were formed thousands of years ago by retreating glaciers, allowing the sea to flood in the remaining space. In the last [ice age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age), glaciers moving  very slowly over time carved deep valleys. This is why fjords can be very deep farther inland where the glacial force was strongest , [Sognefjord](https://www.visitflam.com/activities/fjord-cruise-sognefjord/), is 1308m deep at its deepest and gets shallow towards the sea. Some features of fjords include [coral reefs](https://marinelab.fsu.edu/labs/brooke/research/deep-sea-corals/norwegian-fjords/) and rocky islands called [skerries](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/skerry). Norway has over 1,700 named fjords which increase the jagged coastline from a modest 3000 km to 30,000 km, islands add another 70,000 km  in total creating [the most complex coastline](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Norway/@66.134237,16.2021192,5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x461268458f4de5bf:0xa1b03b9db864d02b!8m2!3d60.472024!4d8.468946) .The dramatic scenery has become a magnet to tourists who enjoy kayaking and other boat sports.

### Richat Structure, Mauretania

[<img src="fig/Richat_Structure_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/49657367588/in/album-72157714991542468/)[Eye of the Sahara](http://geologyscience.com/gallery/eye-of-the-sahara-or-richat-structure/), also known as the Richat structure, is a geological dome made of rocks billions of years old and measures 40.2 km across. Once, there was a temperate forest here, with lakes and rivers. The formation processes of this magnificent structure are still a mistery. The most prominent theory believes, that it's the result of the volcanism and erosion. The theory states, that volcanism in the area lifted the layers of sediments and after it died down, the erosion ate away at the structure, making the shape of an eye we see today. As the structure is visible from space, it serves as a landmark for [astronauts](http://www.lovethesepics.com/2011/04/earths-bulls-eye-the-eye-of-africa-landmark-for-astronauts-14-pics/).
