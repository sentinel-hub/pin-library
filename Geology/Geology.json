Unlike most of the Grand Canyon, portions of the Colca Canyon are habitable, and one can see pre-Inca agricultural terraces still being used by local farmers who practice the same lifestyle as their ancestors. The Colca Canyon was [formed](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HKWF_colca-canyon?guid=f0c26607-22b4-422e-979c-98faed679e7e) by the erosion of volcanic rock caused by the Colca River along the line of a fault on the crust of the earth. Regardless of its depth the Colca Canyon is considered geologically young. Its location near the Valley of the volcanoes, an area of about 40 volcanoes, means that it is a geologically active area. The largest [volcanoes](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~clay/PeruTrip/Talks/PeruVolcanoes-Wicks.pdf) are Sabancayo and Ampato.

On days when a strong wind blows, the fast shifting sand roars, but when light wind blows, the sand produces a gentle, dulcet sounds akin to music. When sliding on the steep slopes of sand dunes from the top, the drifting sands look like beautiful brocades hung up on the sand dunes, accompanied with beautiful singing sound. The singing sounds like the sound from traditional Chinese music instruments. Hence, the dune gets its name because of the singing sound of the sand. The sands really do sing!

Knockan Crag is internationally renowned due to the presence of a geological feature called the \"[Moine Thrust](https://www.geological-digressions.com/tag/knockan-crag/)\" first identified here in the 1860s. The Moine Thrust is a major near horizontal geological fault affecting the rocks, whereby the older rocks have been pushed towards, up and over younger rocks. This is the place where [Moine metamorphic](https://www.scottishgeology.com/best-places/knockan-crag/) rocks have ended up on top of limestone, and at the Moine Thrust at Knockan Crag you can put your hands on these two very different rocks.

Infact, crystalline Moine metamorphic rocks sit on top of a sequence of undisturbed sedimentary rocks which have not been affected by the activity that deformed the overlying rocks.

[The Great Blue Hole of Belize](https://www.marineinsight.com/environment/what-is-the-great-blue-hole-of-belize/), located off the coast of Belize, is one of such wonders. Circular in shape with a diameter of 300 m, the water depth in this hole is 125 m, which gives it a deep blue color in contrast with the aquamarine color of the water neighboring it. Researchers say this giant underwater [sinkhole](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/sinkholes?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects) was originally formed during the last glacial period as a limestone cave when the sea levels were lower. As the ocean began to rise due to [thawing](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/big-thaw/) of polar ice caps, the cave system flooded and eventually collapsed, creating a “vertical cave” in the ocean. As such, this swallow hole is popular among divers, who flock to the area to see the geological formations that now lie in the ocean’s depths. [Researcher divers](https://geographical.co.uk/people/explorers/item/3132-explore-belize-blue-hole) have found huge [stalactites and stalagmites](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/stalactite.html) below the surface, some even reaching 9 – 12 m in length.

      "description":"[Ha long Bay](https://www.beautifulworld.com/asia/vietnam/ha-long-bay/) is an extraordinary beautiful natural wonder in northern Vietnam’s Quang Ninh Province, near the Chinese border. Covering over 1,500 square km area, it comprises of more than 1,600 rocky and earthen islands, typically in the form of jagged limestone pillars jutting out from the sea, and several caves, floating villages and [grottoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grotto), all of which blend together to produce an exotic and picturesque seascape. The existence of surreal seascape has been often explained by the old age [dragon legend](https://www.visithalongbay.com/insight-guides/the-legend-of-halong-bay.html) while scientist have explained that the formations are as a result of 500 million years of strong erosive forces moulding the rocks into fascinating shapes. It is classified as both a [World Heritage Site by UNESCO](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/672), and as one of the New 7 Wonders of Nature and for many tourists, this place is like something right out of a movie. The fact is that Ha long Bay features a wide range of biodiversity, while the surrealistic scenery has indeed featured in endless movies.",

      "description":"With its [red sand dunes](https://www.earthmagazine.org/article/travels-geology-desert-geology-namibia-writer-and-her-father-explore-otherworldly-dunes) rolling endlessly into the ocean, the [Namib](https://www.rovos.com/the-namib-desert) is the oldest desert in the world, existing for at least 55 million years, stretching over 2000 km along Namibia‘s entire Atlantic coast and parts of Angola and South Africa. This extremely [arid ecoregion](https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1315) features dunes, rocky mountainous areas, gravel plains, perennial river mouth wetlands, coastal pans, lagoons, riparian vegetation and isolated springs resulting in a landscape of exceptional beauty. With rainfall varying from 85 mm in the west to just 2 mm in the east, coastal fog is the primary source of water accounting for a unique environment in which endemic [plants and animals](https://www.britannica.com/place/Namib#ref37004) adapt to an ever changing variety of microhabitats and ecological niches. Despite its emptiness, the desert scenery of the Namib has a stark beauty with its striking patterns created by the constantly shifting sand dunes to the dramatic coastline, where shipwrecks shrouded in fog disintegrate slowly into the sand. In addition to being home to the famous solitary [Sossusvlei Dunes](https://www.sossusvlei.org/about/), it is also the site of major mines for tungsten, salt and diamonds.",

It is a long, deep, narrow body of water that reaches far inland. Fjords are often set in a U-shaped valley with steep walls of rock on either side. While fjords are not just a Norwegian phenomenon and can be found in other mountainous regions, the [fjords of Norway](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Fjords_of_Norway) are particularly famous, spread all over the country and easily accessible as the fjord-dominated landscape runs like a strip all around Norway's coast. They were formed thousands of years ago by retreating glaciers, allowing the sea to flood in the remaining space. In the last [ice age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age), glaciers moving very slowly over time carved deep valleys. This is why fjords can be very deep farther inland where the glacial force was strongest, e.g. [Sognefjord](https://www.visitflam.com/activities/fjord-cruise-sognefjord/), is 1308 m deep at its deepest and gets shallow towards the sea. Some features of fjords include [coral reefs](https://marinelab.fsu.edu/labs/brooke/research/deep-sea-corals/norwegian-fjords/) and rocky islands called [skerries](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/skerry). Norway has over 1,700 named fjords which increase the jagged coastline from a modest 3000 km to 30,000 km, islands add another 70,000 km in total creating [the most complex coastline](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Norway/@66.134237,16.2021192,5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x461268458f4de5bf:0xa1b03b9db864d02b!8m2!3d60.472024!4d8.468946).

      "description":"[Eye of the Sahara](http://geologyscience.com/gallery/eye-of-the-sahara-or-richat-structure/), also known as the Richat structure, is a geological dome made of rocks billions of years old and measures 40.2 km across. Once, there was a temperate forest here, with lakes and rivers. The formation processes of this magnificent structure are still a mistery. The most prominent theory believes, that it's the result of the volcanism and erosion. The theory states, that volcanism in the area lifted the layers of sediments and after it died down, the erosion ate away at the structure, making the shape of an eye we see today. As the structure is visible from space, it serves as a landmark for [astronauts](http://www.lovethesepics.com/2011/04/earths-bulls-eye-the-eye-of-africa-landmark-for-astronauts-14-pics/).",
