      "description":"Natron is a fascinating lake, deadly to most animals, that are not accustomed to its alkaline environment. The dangerously high PH of 10.5 is caused by sodium carbonate flowing in from the surrounding hills, active with volcanism. Sodium carbonate deposits serve as a preservant, calcifying the carcasses of deceased animals. Despite the harsh ecosystem, some species survive here. On its shores, flocks of flamingos, which have evolved leathery skin to tolerate the water, find a safe nesting place, as predators avoid the area. The stunning red color is caused by cyanobacteria, that thrive in the dry season, as salinity rises due to evaporation.

Using the powerful northern rivers is expected to create numerous jobs and greatly contribute to agricultural development and sustainability. However, some worry the project would require a million hectares of the catchment area to be bulldozed for irrigation agriculture, as well as a dam to be built, which could significantly dry up the river.

The visualization aims to dynamically visualize the chlorophyll and sediment concentrations in water bodies, the two primary indicators of water quality. Chlorophyll content ranges in colors from dark blue (low chlorophyll content) through green to red (high chlorophyll content). Sediment concentrations are colored brown; opaque brown indicates high sediment content. High chlorophyll and sediment concentrations can both be found on the norther shore, coming from the surrounding agricultural fields. This reduces the [reservoir's water quality (pollution, eutrophication, toxification)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1875372814020048) which poses a risk for the in situ ecosystem.",
