## Included pins 

### Stromboli, Province of Messina, Italy (False Color Urban)

[<img src="fig/Stromboli_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/50082808651/in/dateposted/)[Stromboli](https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/stromboli.html) has been active consistently for at least 2000 years, which is unusual among volcanoes.  Most of its activity consists of brief and smaller bursts of lava 100-200 meters high into the air. Occasionally, longer periods of eruptions occur, lasting from a few to up to 10 years. The most recent one began in December 2002 and ended in July 2003. Although Stromboli's eruptions are not dangerous for the most part, more violent eruptions that take lives and destroy property, do occur. In [July 2019](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48857422), a hiker died during the eruption, several people were injured and many had to flee to the sea. The deadliest [eruption in 1930](http://www.geo.mtu.edu/volcanoes/boris/mirror/mirrored_html/STROMBOLI-1930.html) took 6 lives and caused considerable damage. 

### Jebel Marra, Sudan (not active)

[<img src="fig/Jebel_Marra_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/49126817116/in/dateposted/) You're looking at the dormant Jebel Marra volcano in Sudan. The most prominent feature of this mountain is the volcanic caldera, 
called Deriba Caldera. In its heart lie two volcanic lakes, formed some 3.500 years ago, as the eruptions removed rock material and created a crater. The lakes are supplied by rain and hot springs.
