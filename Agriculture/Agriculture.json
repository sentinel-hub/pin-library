      "description":"The desert country of Saudi Arabia highly relies on irrigation farming for growing crops due to its arid and warm climate. The circular shape of the fields is a result of the irrigation system (center-pivot irrigation) which uses water from a huge fossil aquifer. The size of the field ranges from a few hundred meters up to almost one kilometer, limited by the size of the irrigation system. What started more than 40 years ago as a huge success story, ensuring domestic food security for the kingdom, is becoming more and more problematic as the once rich water reserves are depleting. As a result, Saudi Arabia is buying more and more fields abroad to satisfy domestic demand.

On the northern bank the fields are more regular distributed and show a lower moisture content, on the southern shore the fields are more diverse both in size and alignment and show a higher level of moisture. As the region has in general a quite low annual precipitation (~500 mm/yr) one explanation for the difference in moisture could be the higher prominence of lakes south of the river but also different field management techniques could play a role. Crops grown in the region are mainly cereals, to a smaller extend also rape, sugar beet, and potatoes.

These systems are characterized by subsistence-level production and low yields of crops and livestock. There are about 5.6 million hectares of land under irrigation or equipped with irrigation facilities in the Nile Basin. A large proportion – 97 percent – of the land is located in Egypt and Sudan. Three countries – Egypt, Tanzania, and Uganda – produce large quantities of fish, but the freshwater fisheries resources of the basin are showing signs of being overfished. The top three crops grown in the basin are wheat, fodder, and maize. Livestock farming is also thriving, Ethiopia leading with more than 50 million heads of cattle.

      "description":"Agriculture in the southern part of the dead sea region is dominated by [salt ponds](https://gizmodo.com/salt-ponds-at-the-dead-sea-1560507635) at the southern part of the dead sea and several fields mainly next to both sides of the Jordan Valley Highway. Due to rising global demand for sodium chloride and potassium salts, both found in the dead sea’s salt ponds, the ponds have grown rapidly in number towards the end of the last century. Since then their number stayed at a stable amount of around 50 ponds. The main crop grown on the field is dates but amongst others also tomatoes, eggplants, or olives are being cultivated.
